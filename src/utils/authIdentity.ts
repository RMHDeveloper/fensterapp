// a phone number — this derives a stable, non-deliverable email from the phone
// number so the login UI never has to know Supabase Auth is involved at all.
// Kept in sync by hand with the identical one-liner in scripts/migrate-users-to-auth.mjs
// and supabase/functions/admin-user-sync (plain Node/Deno scripts can't import this file).
